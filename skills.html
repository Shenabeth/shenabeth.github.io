        <p><br>
            In a game development class, my teacher once emphasized the challenge of creating everything 
            professionally in a video game independently. It may be difficult, but it's undeniably achievable. 
            Since 2014, the year I discovered my deep passion for technology, I've embarked on a relentless 
            journey of self-improvement. The belief that being a jack-of-all-trades is a strength has been my 
            guiding principle. I firmly believe in being my own best teammate. <br><br>

            Now, let me take you through my versatile skill set. From wielding paintbrushes to crafting melodies, 
            and delving into the intricate world of coding, I've cultivated a unique blend of artistic, musical, 
            and technical abilities. Each skill contributes to my holistic approach, ensuring that I bring a 
            multidimensional perspective to every project.

        <br><br><h2>Art</h2>
        <p>
            Art has always been about creativity, not the fancy tools. My journey began with nothing more than a 
            pencil and paper. Self-taught in traditional art, I mastered the nuances of graphite before venturing 
            into pens, charcoals, and markers. The transition to the digital realm marked a new chapter, 
            where I initially started with just the precision of my hand and a mouse. Eventually, I embarked on a 
            unique endeavor — creating commissions using nothing but my phone. It was a testament to the idea that 
            art thrives on ingenuity rather than elaborate setups. Today, equipped with a tablet, I seamlessly blend 
            the traditional and digital, bringing my artistic visions to life with every stroke.<br><br>

            <b>add original art</b><br><br>

            I use drawing apps like Medibang and Procreate for sketching and drawing, sometimes just for the initial
            stages. As my art pieces evolve, I may find myself transferring them to vector drawing apps like Adobe 
            Illustrator for the resolution independence offered by SVG. For photo editing and generative fill, I 
            integrate Adobe Photoshop into my workflow. Moreover, my proficiency extends to utilizing AI, whether 
            it's for drawing inspiration or transforming images into unique masterpieces. This intersection of art 
            methods intertwining with cutting-edge digital tools allows me to explore and push the boundaries of 
            my creativity.

        <br><br><h2>Music</h2>
        <p>
            My musical odyssey began with self-taught piano playing, initially without a defined purpose. Intrigued 
            by the enchanting world of video game music, I discovered a passion for creating my own compositions digitally. 
            I transitioned from traditional sheet music to the dynamic realm of MIDI, embarking on a journey from 
            experimenting with loops to crafting entirely original pieces. Despite the ongoing learning process, the 
            joy lies in seamlessly blending my love for music with technology, now capable of crafting my own 
            unique video game soundscapes.

        <br><br><h2>Game Development</h2>
        <p>
            The spark of game development ignited within me decades ago on a Windows XP netbook. In those early days, 
            I immersed myself in crafting choice-based games the Microsoft Office presentation program. Since then, 
            my journey has evolved into the realm of 2D game development with tools like Game Maker. What started as a 
            creative exploration soon turned into a fervent passion, leading me to experiment and independently create 
            games outside the confines of my game development class. Despite some projects being left in the archives, 
            each served as a valuable learning experience. As I continue to evolve in the field, I've ventured into 3D 
            game development using Unity — a new frontier that adds another dimension to my creative endeavors.
